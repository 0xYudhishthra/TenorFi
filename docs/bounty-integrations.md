## 1inch — Build an Aqua App ($5,000)

**What we build.** A custom **SwapVM instruction `_fundingSettle`** that turns a swap into one
period's funding settlement: it reads the latched funding rate, nets it against the locked fixed
rate, clamps to the per-period cap, and writes the result to the swap's output register, so the
router delivers `net` USDC from the payer (maker) to the receiver (taker). It is registered in our
own router (`KeelSwapVMRouter`, which extends `AquaOpcodes` and appends the opcode) and exercised via
a program built by `KeelFundingProgram`.

SwapVM is one-directional (maker → taker), but a funding swap is two-sided, so a Keel position is
**two mirror orders**: one pays the hedger when `realized > fixed` (`makerPaysAbove = true`), the
mirror pays the reserve when `realized < fixed` (`makerPaysAbove = false`). Each order pays `0`
outside its own direction (so a maker is never debited the wrong way) and is **bound to the agreed
counterparty** — it reverts `UnauthorizedTaker` if anyone else tries to take it.

> Canonical end-to-end flow (onboarding + per-period settlement, with diagrams): [`flows.md`](flows.md).

    ROUTER -->|"pull amountOut from maker(payer)"| AQUA["Aqua virtual balances"]
    AQUA -->|deliver USDC| TAKER["receiver (taker)"]
```

**The opcode** (`packages/contracts/src/swapvm/FundingSettle.sol`):

```solidity
function _fundingSettle(Context memory ctx, bytes calldata args) internal view {
    (address fundingIndex, int256 fixedRate, uint256 cap, uint256 notional, uint256 periodSeconds) =
        abi.decode(args, (address, int256, uint256, uint256, uint256));

    uint256 period = block.timestamp / periodSeconds;            // derived on-chain; program stays fixed
    (int256 realized, bool isSet) = IFundingIndex(fundingIndex).getFundingIndex(period);
    require(isSet, FundingNotSet());

    int256 diff = _clamp(realized - fixedRate, cap);             // clamp(R − F, ±cap)
    ctx.swap.amountOut = (_abs(diff) * notional) / RATE_ONE;     // net: maker(payer) → taker(receiver)
}
```

**Registering the opcode** (`KeelOpcodes.sol`) — appended at the end of the Aqua set so existing
indices are preserved; `ProgramBuilder.findOpcode` resolves it by function pointer:

```solidity
function _opcodes() internal pure override
    returns (function(Context memory, bytes calldata) internal[] memory result)
{
    function(Context memory, bytes calldata) internal[] memory base = AquaOpcodes._opcodes();
    result = new function(Context memory, bytes calldata) internal[](base.length + 1);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < base.length; i++) result[i] = base[i];
    result[base.length] = _fundingSettle;
}
```

**Why it's load-bearing.** The swap *literally executes as our opcode* — Aqua/SwapVM is the
settlement engine, not a wrapper. A funding-rate swap is a novel "sophisticated DeFi position" (a
derivative), and "define your own instruction" is the invited use. Collateral stays alive via Aqua
virtual balances. **SwapVM is scored higher** — and we use it for real.

**Status / qualification.** Built; opcode unit-tested + a deploy-wiring test in the single Foundry
package. Settlement is one token, one direction (`tokenIn ≠ tokenOut` is enforced, so the hedge
position is the `tokenIn` with `amountIn = 0` via `allowZeroAmountIn`; USDC is `tokenOut`).
Qualification: onchain token transfer in the demo ✓ · incremental git history ✓ · SwapVM used ✓.

## Chainlink — Best workflow with CRE ($6,000, up to 3×$2k)

**What we build.** A CRE workflow that reads BTC funding from the **Hyperliquid API**, reaches DON
consensus, and writes it on-chain via the canonical consumer path — the KeystoneForwarder calls
`KeelFundingReceiver.onReport`, which decodes `(period, value)` and forwards to
`FundingIndex.setFundingIndex(period, value)`. There is no on-chain funding-rate oracle — without CRE
there is no number to settle against.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    HL["Hyperliquid API<br/>BTC funding (hourly)"] -->|HTTP fetch| CRE["CRE workflow"]
    CRE -->|DON consensus| FWD["KeystoneForwarder"]
    FWD -->|"onReport(metadata, report)"| RECV["KeelFundingReceiver (Base mainnet)"]
    RECV -->|setFundingIndex period, R| IDX["FundingIndex"]
    IDX --> O["_fundingSettle opcode (settlement, over Aqua)"]
    IDX --> M["MCP get_funding"]
```

**The consumer** (`packages/contracts/src/KeelFundingReceiver.sol`) implements Chainlink's
`IReceiver` + ERC-165. The forwarder calls `onReport`, which decodes `(period, value)` from the
report and writes the latch; it is idempotent (skips an already-set period) and also accepts an
owner-rotatable EOA `relayer` as the live-demo fallback.

```solidity
function onReport(bytes calldata, bytes calldata report) external override {
    if (msg.sender != forwarder && msg.sender != relayer) revert NotAuthorized();
    (uint256 period, int256 value) = abi.decode(report, (uint256, int256));
    if (fundingIndex.isSet(period)) { emit ReportSkipped(period); return; }
    fundingIndex.setFundingIndex(period, value);
}
```

**The on-chain latch** (already shipped, `packages/contracts/src/FundingIndex.sol`) — the receiver is
wired in as its `forwarder`:

```solidity
function setFundingIndex(uint256 period, int256 value) external onlyForwarder {
    if (isSet[period]) revert AlreadySet(period);   // write-once per period
    _value[period] = value;
    isSet[period] = true;
    emit FundingIndexSet(period, value);
}
```

**Conventions (locked).**
- `value = R = AFR` (actual funding rate), **signed `int256`, scale `1e18`, PER-PERIOD** — funding can go negative.
- **Annualized → per-period conversion happens OFF-CHAIN, in the CRE workflow.** The contract never sees an annualized rate.
- `period = floor(unixSeconds / PERIOD_SECONDS)`, `PERIOD_SECONDS = 120` for the demo. Everyone (contract, keeper, UI, MCP) uses this exact formula.
- Set the latch's `onlyForwarder` to the `KeelFundingReceiver` (rotatable via `setForwarder`); the receiver in turn gates `onReport` to the CRE KeystoneForwarder (+ the relayer fallback).

**Hyperliquid funding source** (verify schema on the day):
- `POST https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/info`
  - current: `{"type":"metaAndAssetCtxs"}` → asset ctx includes `funding`
  - history: `{"type":"fundingHistory","coin":"BTC","startTime":<ms>}` → `[{coin, fundingRate, premium, time}]`
- HL `fundingRate` is hourly fractional (e.g. `"0.0000125"`); convert to per-period `1e18` signed in the workflow.

**Why it's load-bearing.** Canonical CRE shape: **external API → DON consensus → on-chain state
change** (`setFundingIndex`), not a UI reading a feed. The index is consumed by two parts of the
system — the **`_fundingSettle` opcode** (the settlement path, over Aqua) and the MCP's `get_funding`.

**Qualification.** CRE workflow as orchestration layer ✓ · integrates a blockchain with an external
API (Hyperliquid) ✓ · a successful CRE CLI simulation qualifies (they deploy it live for you) — land
**≥1 real on-chain write** ✓ · makes an on-chain state change (not a UI read) ✓.

**Build steps (Axel).** (1) Base mainnet RPC; CRE on Base mainnet is confirmed — chain name
`ethereum-mainnet-base-1`, selector `15971525489660198786`, production KeystoneForwarder
`0xF8344CFd5c43616a4366C34E3EEE75af79a74482` (simulation MockForwarder
`0x5e342a8438b4f5d39e72875fcee6f76b39cce548`). Get the deployed `KeelFundingReceiver` + `FundingIndex`
from `deployments.json`. (2) Write the workflow: HTTP fetch HL BTC funding → DON consensus → convert
annualized→per-period → encode `(period, value)` → `writeReport` targeting the receiver. (3) Simulate
via CRE CLI (deploy/rotate the receiver's forwarder to the MockForwarder, then `setForwarder()` back to
production). (4) Land one real on-chain write; hand the tx hash to the submission.

**Fallback.** If the DON is flaky by the checkpoint, the authorized **EOA relayer** calls
`KeelFundingReceiver.onReport` with the real API-derived per-period index for the live loop — same
code path, no contract change — but keep ≥1 real CRE write for the bounty.

## LI.FI — Composer ($4,000)

**What we build.** One-click dual-leg onboarding: a LI.FI Composer Flow bridges the user's USDC from
any chain and, in the same flow, (a) deposits collateral into Hyperliquid (HyperCore) for the perp
leg and (b) opens the Keel swap (ships the leg into Aqua via `KeelFundingProgram`/`KeelSwapVMRouter`). The MCP uses Composer as its execution layer
(Agentic Workflows track). *(Section owned by the integration lead; design-doc §6 has the flow.)*

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    USER["USDC on any chain"] -->|LI.FI Composer Flow| BRIDGE["bridge to Base mainnet / HyperCore"]
    BRIDGE --> DEP["deposit collateral → Hyperliquid (perp leg)"]
    BRIDGE --> OPEN["ship Keel leg into Aqua (hedge leg)"]
```

**Why it's load-bearing.** A hedger's capital is rarely already on the settlement chain; without
LI.FI, funding the hedge is a manual multi-step bridge. Composer makes "fund + open both legs" a
single confirmation. **Open item (integration lead):** confirm a single Flow can chain an arbitrary
contract call (the Aqua `ship` that opens the Keel leg) alongside the HL deposit; else two sequenced calls behind one MCP confirmation.

---

## Honesty rules (say these on stage)

- **Never claim "first"** — Rho is live (see design-doc §12). We compete on Aqua-native execution +
  live collateral + the Ethena demo.
- **Real vs scripted:** the lock + USDC settlements are real (Base mainnet); the Ethena crash is a
  *replay* of real historical funding on a slider.
